# Enhancing a Community Library Website Project

## Simulating the roles of two contributors :"Morgan" and "Jamie".

Morgan will focus on adding the Book Reviews section, while james will update the Event's page with new community events.

As a simulation for the existing files the team has, we created the home, about_us, events and contact_us files and staged, committed and pushed them to the main branch repository in github.
